An alumnus from [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en). Now, an assistant professor at PERG (Precision Engineering Research Group) @ EAS, Sophia University.

I am PI of the Precision Engineering Research Group (PERG) at Sophia University, where our research explores the fundamental and applied aspects of tribology, surface engineering, and thermal-fluid science. We investigate the behavior of machine elements under extreme environments, including piston ringâ€“cylinder liner interactions in ammonia-fueled engines and functional surfaces for enhanced boiling heat transfer. Our work combines custom-built experimental rigs, advanced surface characterization, and high-speed imaging to reveal mechanisms of friction, wear, lubrication, and bubble dynamics. With these insights, we aim to enable next-generation sustainable energy systems and durable engine technologies.

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
