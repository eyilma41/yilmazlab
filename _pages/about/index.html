<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a co-PI of the Precision Engineering Research Group (PERG) at Sophia University, along with <a href="https://fst.sophia.ac.jp/en/faculty/hidetake-tanaka" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Tanaka</a>. My research explores the fundamental and applied aspects of tribology, surface engineering, and thermal-fluid science. We investigate the behavior of machine elements under extreme environments, including piston ring–cylinder liner interactions in ammonia-fueled engines and functional surfaces for enhanced boiling heat transfer. Our work combines custom-built experimental rigs, advanced surface characterization, and high-speed imaging to reveal mechanisms of friction, wear, lubrication, and bubble dynamics. With these insights, we aim to enable next-generation sustainable energy systems and durable engine technologies.</p> <p>Prior to joining PERG, I completed my M.Sc. (2017) and Ph.D. (2020) degrees in Mechanical Engineering at Sophia University, supported by the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship. Before that, I worked as a maintenance engineer at Ford Otosan’s <a href="https://www.fordotosan.com.tr/en/operations/production/plants" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yeniköy Plant</a> in Türkiye, where I gained hands-on experience in automotive manufacturing and reliability. I also hold a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering from <a href="https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sabancı University</a>, during which I studied abroad at <a href="https://www.tmu.ac.jp/english/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tokyo Metropolitan University</a>, — an experience that first shaped my long-term academic career in Japan.</p> <p>You can find a copy of my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/Academic_CV_Nov24.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_bibliography/papers.bib</code> and Jekyll will render your <a href="/al-folio/publications/">publications page</a> automatically.
