  title   = {Investigation of intake air temperature effect on co-combustion characteristics of NH$_3$/gasoline in naturally aspirated high compression ratio engine with sub-chamber},
  author  = {Yilmaz, Emir, et al.},
  abstract={Recently, ammonia (NH$_3$), which has a higher energy density than hydrogen, has gained attention for zero-carbon emission goals in the transportation sector. However, in a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE), NH3 combustion mechanism is still under investigation. In this paper, to further expand the knowledge on the adoption of NH3 in ICEs, authors conducted NH3/gasoline co-combustion experiments in a modified, 17.7:1 compression ratio, naturally aspirated spark-assisted CI engine with sub-chamber. The sub-chamber was chosen in order to enhance the combustion speed of NH3. In addition, the sub-chamber was equipped with glow and spark plugs to overcome the high auto-ignition temperature of NH3. Engine performance and NOX emissions were studied under three different intake air temperatures. During the experiments, NH3 content was increased gradually where the engine was run under lean conditions. Although higher NH3 content was achieved compared to our previous work, increasing the intake air temperature resulted in decreased charging efficiency. In addition, corrosion was found on the piston ring after 120 h of operation, negatively affecting the engine performance. Furthermore, NH3/gasoline co-combustion duration was shortened drastically with the influence of the sub-chamber, where the longest combustion duration under the present conditions was found to be 17°CA.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
